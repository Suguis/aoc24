# aoc24

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com) challenges, implemented in the ![lucy](https://gleam.run/images/lucy/lucytiny.svg) [Gleam](https://gleam.run) programming language.

It uses the [gladvent](https://hexdocs.pm/gladvent) library to be easily run in a terminal.

The inputs of the solutions **are not published** since it is not allowed. Citing the original AoC website, it says the following:

> _**Can I copy/redistribute part of Advent of Code?** Please don't. Advent of Code is free to use, not free to copy. If you're posting a code repository somewhere, please don't include parts of Advent of Code like the puzzle text or your inputs. If you're making a website, please don't make it look like Advent of Code or name it something similar._
